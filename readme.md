**Unit Conversion NL**

This is my attempt to write a low latency natural
language input for doing simple unit conversions.
Notably I hope to include some of the less
conventional units and conversions that aren't 
natively supported by a lot of the other conversion websites I've used.  These include conversions of wavelength to inverse centimeter
and proper handling of Siemen to Ohm conversions.

I may also look into adding some more routine calculations,
eg debroglie wavelength calcs, geometric areas, etc. kind of similar to wolfram-alpha.

I am writing this primarily as an excuse to learn django
and dig into web development a bit - no particular or immediate
goals for the project.
